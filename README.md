# text_to_melody_converter
Simple **Python script to convert text into melodies**.

You have to install the pyo package (http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/) for the script to work, using pip (http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/download.html).

The script contains one class and two functions:

The **class Connect()** connects characters to certain frequencies in a dictionary. It has to be imported to let the function convert() work. It also contains reference frequencies (c-h) that can be used.

The **function convert()** reads text files (.txt), converts them into lists of frequencies and returns this lists. It's only argument takes the name of the chosen text file as a string (e.g. freqs = convert("text_file.txt")). This text file has to be in the same directory as the script.

The **function play()** plays the created melody with help of the pyo package. The play()-function takes three arguments: The list of frequencies, the sound and the duration of each tone in seconds. The list of frequencies should be a list you created with convert(). The sound should be created with pyo, for example a sine-wave, because play() is adjustet to pyo's syntax. The duration of each tone in seconds can be an integer or a float.

The script itself is called text_to_melody_converter.py. A script to illustrate the converter interacting with the pyo package is called illustration_with_pyo.py. There is also a text example called text_example.txt, containing the four first lines of Goethe's peom "Erlk√∂nig". This example is used in the illustration file.
